1. Create class YamlField:
	fields:
		string name;
		string content;
	methods: 
		YamlField(name, content);
		getName();
		getContent();
2. Create class YamlFile
	fields:
		list<YamlField>* fields;
	methods:
		YamlFile(fields);
		AddField();
3. Create class YamlBuilder (Parser)
	methods: 
		YamlBuilder();
		YamlFile* CreateYamlFile(string yamlString);
4. Create class YamlComparator
	methods:
		RESULT compare (yamlFile1, yamlFile2); , where RESULT is enum of possible results;

CreateYamlFile: 
	You need split string by '\n'. And starting with second string split each by ':', creating YamlField object and adding it to yamlfile. 
Compare: 
	It's easy: get from both objects YamlFields and start loop for searching same elements.
